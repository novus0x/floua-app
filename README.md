## Login Tracking & Privacy

Floua includes an optional **Login Tracking** feature to improve account security.
When enabled manually from the **Account Settings**, users can see details of their recent login activity, including:

- IP address
- Approximate location (country/city)
- Browser and device used
- Login timestamp

This feature is **completely optional** and is **disabled by default**. Users can choose to activate/deactivate it at any time from their account preferences.

### Thy is this useful?

- Helps users detect suspicious or unauthorized access to their account.
- Enable FLoua to show recent login activity.
- Adds transparency and security for power users.

All login data is used **only for user-facing security feature**. It is never sold or shared with third parties.
